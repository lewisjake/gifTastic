This program was made using html, javascript (jQuery & ajax), and css. The program is meant for the user to add videogames to the current array of videogames already on the page. Using jQUery, the input turns into a button and is displayed back to the user. Ajax is then used along with an API Key to go out and retrieve gifs and ratings from another server. jQuery is then used to animate or return the image to still with an on-click function.
